I am a PhD Candidate in Health Care Management and Economics at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. I am on the job market during the 2020-2021 academic year.

I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in health economics and industrial organization. My dissertation research is on the economics of health insurance and specifically, the effects of different forms of demand-side cost-sharing. My job market paper studies the effects of manufacturer copay assistance programs for pharmaceuticals in response to high cost-sharing for outpatient prescription drugs.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked in health care consulting and as a research assistant in the department of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I received my undergraduate degree in Economics and Psychology from Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN.
